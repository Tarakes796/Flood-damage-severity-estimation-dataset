# Flood-severity-estimation-dataset
We created a new dataset of size 310 for the regression task using the Floodnet dataset. We manually labeled ground truth values for 310 images. Non-flooded images were labeled as 0, while flooded images were divided into four severity levels: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, focusing on buildings, roads, and vehicles affected by the flood event. We generated pseudo-thermal images for the 310 labeled RGB images using the CycleGAN network.
